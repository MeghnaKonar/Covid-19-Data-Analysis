# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
COVID-19 data analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook involves the use of various libraries and tools to explore, visualize, and interpret COVID-19-related datasets. Here's a brief overview of the steps you might take:

Importing Libraries:
Commonly used libraries for data analysis in Python include Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Loading Data:
Obtain a COVID-19 dataset, which could include information such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time. Datasets are often available from reliable sources like Johns Hopkins University or government health agencies. Here, I have used dataset from Kaggle

Data Exploration:
Examine the structure of the dataset, check for missing values, and understand the data types.

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, outliers, and format data for analysis.

Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to better understand trends and patterns in the data.

Statistical Analysis:
Conduct statistical analysis to derive insights.
